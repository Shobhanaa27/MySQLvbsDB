# MySQLvsbDB
The database consisted of five tables: Admin, User, Booking_user, Bookings, and Healthcentre. Each table was created using CREATE TABLE statements with appropriate data types, primary keys, and foreign keys to maintain referential integrity. I inserted initial sample data using INSERT queries to enable testing and demonstration of functionality. The schema supports core operations such as managing admin details, storing user profiles, tracking health centres, recording bookings, and mapping booking-user relationships. This design ensures accurate record-keeping and efficient retrieval of vaccination slot details.
